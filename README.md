# Mental Health Runbooks

## Introduction

This came about as an idea discussed during PNW CoffeeOps. We mused about the idea of runbooks for mental health in a similar way that we think about runbooks for production systems and infrastructure. 

## Methodology

I'm starting with runbooks written as Jupyter Notebooks. I like Jupyter for runbook writing, as you can place explanatory text next to actionable code. I'm hoping that this style will lead to little scripts and other tools that can help deal with situations where I know something's not quite right with my mental health, but I can't quite put my finger on it.
