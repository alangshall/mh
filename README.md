# Mental Health Runbooks

## Introduction

This came about partially as an idea discussed during a PNW CoffeeOps session. We mused about the idea of runbooks for mental health in a similar way that we think about runbooks for production systems and infrastructure. 

## Methodology

I'm starting with runbooks written as Jupyter Notebooks. I like Jupyter for runbook writing, as you can place explanatory text next to actionable code. I'm hoping that this style will lead to little scripts and other tools that can help deal with situations where I know something's not quite right with my mental health, but I can't quite put my finger on it.

## Diagnostics

A suggested list of diagnostics are in diagnose.ipynb. They are an expanded version of some diagnostic ruminations I wrote about in [my blog](https://tilde.town/~alliesanders/blog/#20231212). 

## Contributors and Licensing

I'd love additional contributions. I'm considering how to create runbooks that will help the person running them do step-by-step walkthroughs of "remediation actions." 

Take whatever you want, adapt it, remix it, give credit. If you find it useful, I'd like to know. If you want to contribute, please do it.
